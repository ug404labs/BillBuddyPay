### Brief History
The project started as **BillBuddyPay** in 2024 during a DevFest competition, where it emerged as the winner. Initially conceived as a MiniPay wallet extension for the Opera browser, it has since evolved into a full-fledged decentralized application. With the launch of the beta version, the app was expanded to utilize the full EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chain, allowing users to access the app from anywhere.

**Mpeke** now operates on both the Optimism and Celo chains, giving users the flexibility to choose the chain that best suits their needs. Each chain offers unique benefits, ensuring that users can enjoy the best possible experience.

### About The Project
**Mpeke** is designed to make group financial management as easy as possible. Built on the Optimism chain for its low fees and fast transactions, Mpeke leverages the power of blockchain to ensure all transactions are secure, transparent, and automatic.

With Mpeke, users can:
- **Split expenses**: Effortlessly split bills and expenses among friends, ensuring everyone pays their fair share.
- **Manage sacco groups**: Create and manage sacco (savings) groups, set contribution amounts, periods, and easily track savings progress.
- **Joint investments**: Participate in joint investments, making it easy for groups to pool resources for larger financial goals.

### Key Features
- **Group Expense Splitting**: Easily split bills and expenses among friends, with automatic tracking of who owes what.
- **Sacco Group Management**: Create and manage savings groups with customizable settings for contributions, duration, and member management.
- **Automatic Payments**: Set up recurring payments within groups to ensure that contributions and payments are made on time.
- **Joint Investments**: Pool resources with friends for joint investments, with transparent tracking and management of funds.
- **Phone Number Linking**: Link EVM wallets to phone numbers for easy access and management of group finances, leveraging the power of decentralized identity (DID).

### How It Works
1. **Sign Up**: Register with your phone number and verify it using OTP. Upon verification, an EVM wallet is automatically created and linked to your number.
2. **Create/Join a Group**: Start a new group or join an existing one for expenses or savings. Customize the group settings as needed.
3. **Manage Transactions**: Use your Mpeke wallet to send, receive, or split payments. All transactions are recorded on the Optimism chain for transparency.
4. **Track Progress**: Keep track of all group expenses, contributions, and investments within the app. Automated notifications ensure everyone stays informed.
